# Important Info
- Do not remove the credits! (Otherwise as I find out you will die) <3
- Amazon enforces a per-user limit of 5 notifications in a 5 minute period. If you try to send more than 5 notifications within a 5 minute period, the api ignores your sixth request and returns a HTTP 429 error.
- The way Alexa notifications work is that you hear a chime sound and the Echo's light ring illuminates to let you know you have pending notifications. When you hear the tone or see the light, say "Alexa, what are my notifications" to hear your notifications.
